# ProxyShield

ProxyShield is a platform for digital attendance that can be used as a useful tool for reducing the number of proxy attendees in a setting such as a school, workplace, or events. The concept is simple: instead of traditional pen-and-paper attendance, the website provides an online platform for recording and tracking attendance in real-time. 

The website has two separate dashboards: one for teachers and another for students. In the student dashboard, students can see their attendance percentage, while teachers can take attendance using the camera. This is a type of biometric using a camera that takes a photo of the student's face, and if their face matches the images present in our database, their attendance will be marked automatically. 

The website is developed using the Flask framework.
